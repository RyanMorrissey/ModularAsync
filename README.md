# ModularAsync
An example of Dependency Injection, Asynchronous Programming, and JSON Parsing - 9/9/2018
The idea was to create reusable, modular code while taking advantage of Dependency Injection and Asynchronous practices.  Depending on the Config file is set up, it will generate multiple "Worker" objects that will start and end commands based on a timer.  This could be used in testing, by generating messages or manipulating information through automated means.
